      During an outbreak of Yellow Fever in Brazil in 2018, there was a global
      shortage of vaccines. In the face of those limitations and the virus’s
      rapid spread, health officials in Brazil decided to administer fractional
      dosing. They gave people one-fifth of the normal dose.

      It was impossible to isolate what activated Duke’s metamorphosis. Today,
      more than four decades after meeting the Wiz, and with years of having
      covered some of the worst global atrocities known to humanity, my
      encounter with Duke continues to trigger terror dreams forged in fact.

      A selection of Ku Klux Klan robes and hoods in various colours hang on a
      coat rack. Grand wizard David Duke’s ground-floor office is across the
      street from an integrated primary school. Duke grabs an unloaded rifle and
      sticks it out an open window. “Bang-Bang,” he shouts, pointing the weapon
      towards a group of Black children outside for recess.

      Satan recently made a cameo appearance on France’s most watched evening
      news programme. He popped up to spit enthusiasm on January’s attempted
      coup d’état in America and stimulate the Big Lie that the results of the
      2020 US Presidential Election were illegal.

      The on-screen demon’s legal name was David Ernest Duke, a 71-year-old
      self-described white nationalist, anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim conspiracy
      theorist, convicted felon, and hierophant of twice impeached former
      President Donald J. Trump.
    </p>
    <p>
      America best knows Duke as the erstwhile grand wizard of the Knights of
      the Ku Klux Klan, America’s oldest white supremacist terrorist hate group
      and star of director D.W. Griffith’s 1915 silent movie “Birth of a
      Nation”.

      Some Americans venerate Duke as their champion. Last week, for instance,
      the Texas Senate voted to eliminate a requirement that public schools in
      America’s second-largest state teach that the Ku Klux Klan and its white
      supremacist campaigns of terror are “morally wrong”. Others scorn him as a
      mostly forgotten elder statesman of racism. Facebook banned him in 2018.
      Twitter in 2020 cut his feed to 53,000 followers for “hateful conduct”.
    </p>

    <p>
      Duke remains a ghoulish thread in the nation’s fabric, lingering proof
      that there’s no longer anything in America too monstrous for human
      credibility.

      I can guarantee Duke meets that pitiless definition because the New York
      Daily News, where I covered crimes in New York City to civil wars in Latin
      America, in 1978 sent me to meet him in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, and
      return with a detailed story about how this child of the peace, love and
      brown rice 1960s somehow missed Woodstock and was transformed into a
      professional racist. The conventional wisdom at the time assured us that
      America’s Baby Boomer generation – those, like Duke, born between 1946 and
      1964 – of conservative and liberal political superstars was more
      enlightened. Duke was an exotic mutation who could not endure.
