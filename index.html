        >Industrial giant Jamuna Group is going to invest up to Tk 1,000 crore
        in beleaguered e-commerce platform Evaly.</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Initially, Jamuna will invest Tk 200 crore and the rest in phases, Evaly
      said in a statement yesterday.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We, as a local venture, are really pleased to have another local company
      by our side," said Mohammad Rassel, founder and CEO of Evaly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this investment, Jamuna has become part of the ongoing investments
      coming into Evaly. The business group has the opportunity to invest in the
      next phase as well, he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The disclosure comes at a time when several agencies, including the
      Anti-Corruption Commission, have been carrying out investigations into the
      alleged embezzlement or transfer of Tk 338.62 crore by Evaly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The move created concerns among many customers and merchants of Evaly
      about whether they would get delivery of their products or get refunds.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      A recent Bangladesh Bank probe said the liabilities of Evaly to its
      customers stood at Tk 213.94 crore and to merchants Tk 189.85 crore as of
      March 14.
    </p>
    <p>
      The digital commerce platform had a total asset of Tk 91.69 crore as of
      March 14. Its current asset was Tk 65.17 crore, according to the probe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the investigation, the commerce ministry early this month
      suggested the ACC, home ministry, the Directorate of National Consumer
      Rights Protection and Bangladesh Competition Commission to investigate the
      allegation against Evaly, which now has around 50 lakh registered
      customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the statement, Evaly yesterday said it would spend the fresh investment
      money on future development and creating new scopes for business.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are trying to get more investment to deliver old orders to customers
      and clear our backlogs, Rassel said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking to The Daily Star, Jamuna Group Director Monika Islam said, We
      signed a memorandum of understanding today. We are investing in Evaly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said the group would invest Tk 100-200 crore initially. If needed, we
      will invest Tk 1,000 crore in phases and in different forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monika said Jamunas main goal is to strengthen the e-commerce platform in
      Bangladesh. After an analysis, we have found that Evaly platform is very
      big. If a big group like us joins Evaly, they will become stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, she said the ratio of shareholding at Evaly has not been fixed
      yet. You will come to know about it soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the central banks probe and asset-liability mismatch of Evaly, she
      said the crisis was related to fund management and thats why the online
      platform was looking for an investor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jamuna has been doing business with quality products and services in the
      country, she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jamuna Future Park is the largest offline marketplace in Bangladesh and
      Evaly will remain as the largest online marketplace with Jamuna Group,
      Monika added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shamim Islam, managing director of Jamuna Group, said the current global
      business trend shows that e-commerce can play a vital role in economic
      development of a country.

    <p>
      After being eliminated from the second round of the men's individual
      recurve event at the Tokyo Olympics, Bangladesh's top archer Ruman Sana
      felt the urge to smash his bow shortly before returning to his senses and
      setting his sights on a gold medal at the 2028 Olympics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bangladesh's dream of winning an elusive medal at the Olympics this time
      hinged on Ruman, especially as the 26-year-old became the nation's second
      athlete to earn a direct ticket for the Olympics.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Ruman's journey ended in the second round as he suffered a 4-6
      set points loss to Canada's Duenas Crispin, ranked 36th in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruman, 25th in the world rankings, enjoyed a good start with a 7-3 set
      points win over Tom Hall of Great Britain in the first round, but the
      archer from Bangladesh Ansar crumbled in the second round despite getting
      off to a winning start.
    </p>
    <p>
      He beat Crispin in the first set 26-25 before losing two straight sets to
      fall behind 2-4. The lad from Khulna bounced back to level things at 4-4
      ahead of the fifth and final set, which went down to the final shot.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Ruman needed to hit the bullseye and score 10 to win the game and advance
      to the third round or square things up and force a tiebreaker by hitting a
      nine, but he could only manage eight and was eliminated.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      "I can't forgive myself because I had a lot of opportunities to win the
      match. I felt like destroying my bows and arrows and leaving archery. I
      tried to put up my natural performance without any pressure but luck
      wasn't with me because the shots which hit 9s were supposed to hit 10," a
      frustrated Ruman told The Daily Star over the phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There were many chances to win the match but I couldn't capitalise on any
      of them. I could have even taken the match into a tiebreak had I hit nine
      on the last shot, but I could only hit eight," said Ruman, who had
      targeted winning the first two rounds before possibly fighting it out
      against top-seed Kim Je Deok of South Korea, who was surprisingly beaten
      by 33rd-ranked Florian Unruh of Germany in the third round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before departing for Japan, Ruman had told The Daily Star that Bangladesh
      should not think of winning medals at the Olympics at the moment because
      even qualifying was a struggle. He added that when a lot of archers would
      qualify for the Olympics directly, then the dream of winning a medal would
      come true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Replying to a query, Ruman said: "The people of country might have dreamt
      of me winning a medal in the Olympics because they saw my ability to win
      silver and bronze medals in the World Archery Championships and World Cup.
      But it is really naïve to think of an Olympic medal because it is a really
      hard job."
    </p>
    <p>He also lamented the drop in form brought about by the pandemic.</p>
    <p>
      "If I could have finished among the 10 archers in the Ranking round on the
      back of the form that I had in 2019, then I could have done something at
      the Olympics. However, my target is gold in the 2028 Olympics, so I'm
      going to play for the 2024 Olympics. From now, I have to toil harder, play
      more international tournaments and Games and improve my ability to realise
      my target."
    </p>
    <p>
      The 26-year-old also urged the concerned authorities to increase
      facilities and incentives for archers so that the next generation is
      attracted and delivers their best on big stages like the Olympics.
